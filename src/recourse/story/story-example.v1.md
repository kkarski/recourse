Based on the JTBD framework provided, here's a step-by-step process for creating user stories that ensures adherence to all principles and guidelines:

### **Step-by-Step Story Creation Process**

#### **Phase 1: Discovery & Clarification**

1. **Ask JTBD Context Questions**:
    - *Customer Context*: "What specific, observable situation triggers this need? (e.g., 'When my flight gets canceled at midnight' vs. 'When travel plans change')"
    - *Current Struggle*: "What frustrations occur with current solutions? (e.g., 'I waste 2 hours calling airlines')"
    - *Desired Progress*: "What does meaningful success look like? (e.g., 'Arrive at my meeting without losing composure')"
    - *Constraints*: "What might block adoption? (e.g., 'Anxiety about app reliability when stressed')"

#### **Phase 2: Draft Core Story Components**

2. **Title**:
    - *Format*: Start with "[Desired Progress]"
    - *Example*: "Arrive at critical events calmly despite travel disruptions" *(not* "Flight rebooking feature")

3. **Job Statement**:
    - *When*: Combine **specific circumstance + emotional context** (e.g., "When my flight cancels last-minute *while I’m rushing to a keynote speech*, feeling panicked about missing it...")
    - *I want to*: Merge **functional + emotional jobs** (e.g., "...find a reliable alternative *while maintaining professionalism*")
    - *So I can*: State **progress + why it matters** (e.g., "...deliver my speech confidently *to strengthen my industry reputation*")

#### **Phase 3: Analyze Behavioral Forces**

4. **Forces Analysis**:
    - *Push*: Extract pain points from current struggles (e.g., "Call centers take 45+ mins on hold").
    - *Pull*: Identify hoped-for improvements (e.g., "Instant rebooking notifications").
    - *Anxiety*: Surface fears about change (e.g., "New app might overcharge during urgency").
    - *Habit*: Acknowledge inertia (e.g., "Default to calling because ‘it’s always worked’").

#### **Phase 4: Define Progress & Validation**

5. **Success Criteria**:
    - *Functional*: Quantifiable outcomes (e.g., "Book new flight in <5 mins").
    - *Emotional*: Feeling shifts (e.g., "Reduce panic to calm focus").
    - *Social*: Perception goals (e.g., "Be seen as prepared by colleagues").

6. **Validation Metrics**:
    - *Hire Rate*: "% target users adopting solution during cancellations".
    - *Progress Indicators*: "Time saved vs. old method", "Pre-event stress scores".

#### **Phase 5: Build Testable Criteria**

7. **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - *Functional*: "Given flight cancellation at 3AM, When I tap ‘rebook’, Then options appear in <10 secs".
    - *Emotional*: "Given high anxiety, When I see cost transparency, Then I feel in control".
    - *Social*: "Given colleagues waiting, When I share new itinerary, Then it looks polished".

8. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
    - Prioritize based on forces (e.g., *Performance*: "Load alternatives in <3s during peak travel"; *Security*: "Payment auto-hides in public spaces").

#### **Phase 6: Quality Assurance**

9. **Checklist Review**:
    - Verify each box (e.g., "Does the title avoid features?", "Do metrics track *progress* not just usage?").
    - *Critical Check*: "Does this make the team *care* about the customer’s anxiety?"

10. **Add JTBD Insights**:
    - Append 1-2 sentences explaining key revelations (e.g., "Anxiety about hidden costs outweighs desire for speed – trust is the real job").
