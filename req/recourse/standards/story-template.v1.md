## Story Structure:
**Title:** [Progress Statement]

**Job to be Done:**
When [specific circumstance/trigger + emotional context],
I want to [functional job + emotional job],
So I can [desired progress/outcome + why it matters].

**Forces Analysis:**
- **Push:** [Current struggle/frustration]
- **Pull:** [Attraction to better solution]
- **Anxiety:** [Concerns about adopting new approach]
- **Habit:** [Comfort/inertia with current way]

**Success Criteria (Customer Progress):**
- **Functional Progress:** [Measurable task improvements]
- **Emotional Progress:** [Confidence, reduced anxiety gains]
- **Social Progress:** [Desired perception by others]

**Business Rules:**
- **Eligibility Rules:** [Who can/cannot access this capability]
  - IF [condition] THEN [access granted/denied]
  - WHEN [user type/role] THEN [permissions level]
- **Process Rules:** [How the job must be executed]
  - MUST [required sequence/workflow steps]
  - CANNOT [prohibited actions/combinations]
- **Data Rules:** [Information constraints and requirements]
  - REQUIRED [mandatory data fields/formats]
  - OPTIONAL [nice-to-have information]
- **Temporal Rules:** [Time-based constraints]
  - WITHIN [timeframe] MUST [complete action]
  - AFTER [event] THEN [enable/disable capability]
- **Calculation Rules:** [Business logic for computations]
  - IF [conditions] THEN [formula/calculation method]
  - WHEN [threshold reached] THEN [action triggered]

**Validation Logic:**
- **Input Validation:**
  - **Format Rules:** [Data type, length, pattern requirements]
  - **Range Rules:** [Min/max values, acceptable options]
  - **Dependency Rules:** [Field relationships and conditional requirements]
- **Business Logic Validation:**
  - **Consistency Checks:** [Cross-field validation rules]
  - **State Validation:** [Valid transitions and status combinations]
  - **Authorization Checks:** [Permission-based access validation]
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Failures:** [Error messages and recovery paths]
  - **Exception Scenarios:** [Edge cases and fallback behaviors]
  - **User Guidance:** [Help text and correction suggestions]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **Functional Jobs:** Given [circumstance], When [action], Then [progress made]
- **Emotional Jobs:** Given [anxiety], When [using solution], Then [feel confident]
- **Social Jobs:** Given [social context], When [presenting], Then [perceived as competent]
- **Business Rule Compliance:** Given [rule condition], When [action attempted], Then [rule enforced correctly]
- **Validation Scenarios:** Given [invalid input], When [submitted], Then [appropriate error shown and guidance provided]

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** [Speed/efficiency thresholds enabling progress]
- **Reliability:** [Consistency needed for trust]
- **Security:** [Protection requirements for peace of mind]
- **Usability:** [Ease-of-use standards for adoption]
- **Maintainability:** [Rule modification and validation logic update requirements]
- **Auditability:** [Logging and tracking requirements for business rule execution]

**Validation Metrics:**
- **Hire Rate:** [% adopting solution when job arises]
- **Fire Rate:** [% abandoning solution]
- **Progress Indicators:** [Leading metrics showing job completion improvement]
- **Satisfaction:** [Emotional/social job fulfillment measures]
- **Rule Compliance:** [% of transactions following business rules correctly]
- **Validation Effectiveness:** [% of invalid inputs caught before processing]
- **Error Recovery:** [% of users successfully completing job after validation error]

**Dependencies & Constraints:**
- **System Dependencies:** [External systems, APIs, or services required]
- **Data Dependencies:** [Required data sources or integrations]
- **Regulatory Constraints:** [Compliance requirements affecting business rules]
- **Technical Constraints:** [Platform limitations affecting validation implementation]

**Assumptions & Risks:**
- **Business Rule Assumptions:** [Assumed conditions for rule applicability]
- **Validation Assumptions:** [Expected user behavior and data quality]
- **Change Management Risks:** [Impact of rule modifications on existing users]
- **Performance Risks:** [Validation complexity impact on user experience]
