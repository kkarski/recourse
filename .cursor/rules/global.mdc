- Keep alembic entity classes in [model.py](mdc:src/recourse/model.py) 
- Keep llama-index workflow event classes in their respective workflow file
- Keep external trigger events in [event.py](mdc:src/recourse/story/event.py) 
- Use specific exception types rather than generic alembic errors from [exception.py](mdc:src/recourse/exception.py)
